Here's a simple Java program to find the frequency of characters in a string:


```
public class CharFrequency {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "pictureperfect";
        str = str.toLowerCase();

        for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
                if (str.charAt(i) == c) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            if (count > 0) {
                System.out.println(c + "-" + count);
            }
        }
    }
}
```


Explanation:


1. Convert the input string to lowercase.
2. Iterate through each alphabet character ('a' to 'z').
3. For each alphabet character, iterate through the input string.
4. Count occurrences of the alphabet character.
5. Print character and frequency if count > 0.


Output:


```
c-2
e-3
f-1
i-1
p-2
r-2
t-2
u-1
```


This program is concise and easy to understand, but less efficient for large strings due to nested loops.
